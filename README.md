# Webpack Asset Map Plugin

Creates a json file that any server side technology can consume for asset declarations. Example output file:

``` json
{
    "./images/favicon.png": "/assets/8f6f13d598e912ac61d3bc88b248ec8e.png",
    "./images/javascript.png": "/assets/32e1e05a1be1599842f488647e1d04f0.png"
}
```

The key is the relative path from the generated file to the image location in your source location. The value is the public url slug generated by webpack.

## Usage

Add to the plugins array in your webpack config:

``` javascript
var AssetMapPlugin = require('asset-map-webpack-plugin');

module.exports = {
  ...
  plugins: [
    new AssetMapPlugin(publicPath, outputFilename)
  ]
};
```
